# MSc Thesis Implementation in Python #
This is my Thesis Implementation for the degree of Master of Science in Applied Informatics.
The program is all about a Colored Petri Net Model that simulates the process of Green Supply Chains in a hypothetical Automotive Industry. It implements object-oriented programming for the creation of classes that have to do with the colored tokens in the system. It uses variables suchs as costs, profits e.t.c that affect the system and are based on randomness. The purpose of the program is not to optimize but to represent the production process of automobiles in an industry. The folder Thesis Project contains the Python modules that compose the program. The folder Simulation Results consists of .txt files that the program outputed after it had ran 10 simulations
